Using Digital Standards with Polarion -  the DIN DKE SPEC 99200 live in action
Heinz Dresbach, Andreas Wernicke, Dirk Buchholz + DIN Media + DKE - Siemens/DIN Media/DKE

DIN DKE SPEC 99200 “ReqIF™ - Interpretation for public standards” has been available to the public since mid-February 2025. With the help of this specification, technical rules, and legal standards can be delivered in a uniform ReqIF™ format for usage in requirements management systems like Polarion – and a Polarion project template for this is freely available now.
In this workshop, you can learn and discuss about the usage of digital standards in Polarion with that project template, and also about the motivation, the makers, and the future of the DIN DKE SPEC 99200 project.
