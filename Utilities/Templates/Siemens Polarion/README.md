# Polarion Project Template "DINDKE99200"

## Scope

A Polarion project template to easily import and use digital standards as defined in DIN DKE SPEC 99200.

## Basic Functions

- import ReqIFs compliant to DIN DKE SPEC 99200 with a few clicks (the whole data model and import mapping is already in)

- easily change the document layout (i.e. which attributes are visible in the document and in the sidebar), by selecting any other document as a template

- easily read, search and find parts of standards relevant for your projects

- link your project requirements to those standards parts, to easily trace from standards requirements to your project decisions and back (e.g. in audit trail)

- easily find out which standards parts are used in which projects

## Notes

- The project template can be used with Polarion 2410 or newer (including Polarion X).

- As any Polarion project template, you can upload it to your Polarion from the "Global Administration"->"Project templates" menu (requires the global role "admin").

- It is good practice to have just one dedicated Polarion project for the handling of the digital standards (rather than to import them to multiple projects), but you also can have multiple ones.
