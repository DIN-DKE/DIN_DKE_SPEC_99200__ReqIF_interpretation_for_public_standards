# Validating the data model release 1.3 (Schematron)

Schematron deliverables to validate a ReqIF™ file against this specification

These Schematron files can be used to check the Schema Definition of a ReqIF™ file against the Schema defined in the DIN DKE SPEC 99200.
- The files test multiple areas of the Schema, like DataTypeDefinitions, Enumerations and EnumerationValues.
- There are different files for ReqIF™ files with one SpecObjectType (1sot: provision) and three SpecObjectTypes (3sot: document, heading, provision).
- Differences between DIN and DKE specific attribute definitions are also covered.
